# PhD Milestones for 2023

### AIEplace SW tasks:

&#x2610; Refamiliarize with my python implementation.
-  &#x2610; Review `createGoldenDCT.py`, `createGoldenHPWL.py` and `customDCT.py`. 
-  &#x2610; Add briefs for functions to add clarity.
-  &#x2610; Modify for usefulness in Vitis project.


&#x2610; Refamiliarize with DREAMplace implementation.

&#x2611; Walk through basic CMake tutorial.

&#x2611; Investigate using the Limbo repository for LEF/DEF parsers
