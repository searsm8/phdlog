Today I was able to get the AIEplace one-iter running in simulation on my own computer!

Using WSL2, I already had Vivado and Vitis installed. I generated an AIE license (free from Xilinx, just have to download it).

`make aie` failed initially because only 4GB of memory was allocated to WSL, and the `swapfile` which enables virtual memory in WSL was also the default 4GB. This is not enough memory for Vitis to run AIE compilations, so I simply increased the swapfile size to 16GB.

Now `make aie` and `make sim` complete without error, though they are quite slow on my machine! 

`make sim` shows a full iteration of DCTs working correctly!
