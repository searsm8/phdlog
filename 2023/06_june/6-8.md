In the Limbo library, to run the example for Bookshelf parsing:

`g++ -o test_bison test_bison.cpp -I $LIMBO_DIR/include -L $LIMBO_DIR/lib -lbookshelfparser -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0 -lgzstream -lz`

I had to add the last 3 pieces:
- `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` to use the same ABI as when compiling the Limbo libraries
- `-lgzstream` to resolve `gzstream undefined` compile error
- `-lz` to resolve `undefined gzopen/gzread` compile error


But let's concentrate on understanding DEF/LEF parser, and use it in my own code.

I realize I don't really understand Cmake, so I'm going to spend some time trying to understand the basics: https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/A%20Basic%20Starting%20Point.html

&#x2610; Walk through basic CMake tutorial.
- &#x2611; Step 1 (june 6)
- &#x2611; Step 2 (june 7)
- &#x2611; Step 3 (june 7)
- &#x2611; Step 4 (june 7)
- &#x2611; Step 5 (june 8)
- &#x2611; Step 6 (trivial)
- &#x2610; Step 7
- &#x2610; Step 8
- &#x2610; Step 9
- &#x2610; Step 10
- &#x2610; Step 11
- &#x2610; Step 12

After completing the first half of the tutorial, I have a good sense of what Cmake is used for and roughly how to do it. I don't need to finish the rest unless I write my own CMakes.
