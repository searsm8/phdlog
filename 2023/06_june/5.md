Today I made a list of milestones `phdlow/milestones.md` which I hope to use to set subtask goals and see the progess I have made over time. Each day should focused on just one or two subtasks to complete.

I am now looking closely at the Limbo repository to use as a LEF/DEF parser:

&#x2611; Basic LEF/DEF example working in Limbo repo.
- To get it working, I had to add `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` option to the compile command (to match what was used when compiling the project):

    g++ -o test_adapt test_adapt.cpp -I $LIMBO_DIR/include -L $LIMBO_DIR/lib -ldefparseradapt -D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0

- I believe what I need to use for parsing can be found in the example: `Limbo/test/parsers/def/test_adapt.cpp`

&#x2610; Examine `test_adapt.cpp` for understanding of API.

&#x2610; Write my own code to use the DEF parser. 

- &#x2610; Play around with what comes out!
