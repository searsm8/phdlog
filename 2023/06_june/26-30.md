# Previous Objectives

&#x2611; In AIEplace::DataBase, make it easy to access all nets of a particular size. (i.e. make a map of pointers)

&#x2611; Fix nullptr segfault (when reading in nets)

- &#x2611; Create Pin class to handle IO pins in the design (not pins on macros)

- &#x2611; Make Pin and Component class extend Node.

&#x2610; Log into HACC and run one_iter.

- &#x2611; Get UIUC VPN working.

- &#x2611; Get into HACC cluster.

&#x2610; Enable reading bookshelf format (big blue benchmarks).

# New Objectives

&#x2610; Install KLayout and see if it is useful as a viewer.

&#x2610; Implement AIEplace logging.

&#x2610; Merge host to AIE driver code 

- &#x2610; Install Petalinux/SDK

&#x2610; read AutoDMP

&#x2610; Add Steiner tree RSMT and HPWL to Net.cpp

# Long term Objectives

&#x2610; ePlace optimization by using simulated annelaing (or other hill climbing algo) on the hyperparams of the ePlace algo. Basically do the HLS project but with AIEplace.
