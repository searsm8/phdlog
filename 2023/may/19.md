On my own machine in WSL:
AIEplace branch one-iter:

`make xsa` completes without error

`make pkg` fails due to lack of rootfs. I must find and download it, and my environment variable `$ROOTFS` needs to point to it.

Solved by downloading the versal-common image, extracting, and adding to my bashrc:

`export VERSAL_COMMON=/home/msears/Xilinx/Downloads/xilinx-versal-common-v2022.2`

`export ROOTFS=${VERSAL_COMMON}/rootfs.ext4`

`export IMAGE=${VERSAL_COMMON}/Image`


Now working on running a HW emulation of the one-iter design to examine it closely.
